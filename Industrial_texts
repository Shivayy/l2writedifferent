(now is the only thing that's real)

binge, cringe, cringe, binge, sloppy
binge, cringe,

(the police used to watch over the people, 
now they're watching the people)

sloppy, 
mincing, 
eye dropping, 
biopsy.
cyclops overlooks 
optic options.
rotten, 
showstopper, 
skin popper.
babbler dabbler.
self confessed 
criminal.
tore pen in vain.
instant, 
it's still spellbound.
game stock, 
talk back rock.
reencounter incident. 
subsistence is inexistent.

(now is the only thing that's real)

non committed, 
unwitted, 
oblivious.
habitual 
resistor. 
roughed up edge, 
fluent nudge, 
pre-collect ignition.
motivation inexistent.

wasted views,
that’s all they see, blue.
hot blood, 
guilt, 
optic nerve.
with the right attitude 
you will succeed, blue.
self abusive 
recluse, 
too late for me.
make 
shifting peace 
unsettling.
and im crazy...
doing crazy things. 
keep your eyes open, 
soft spoken changes nothing.
a view 
so cruel.

nothin (a few)

dogs body comatose, 
torchlight roast.
disinterest. 
disinfect.
retold, 
impressed by possession.
insiders know refresh, 
detained contest.
all that is pure, 
sure tonight, 
freeze in time.
shadows climb, 
distracting override.
instincts evolve, 
over and over.

why cant you see this?

(do you, don't you want me to make you?
coming down fast but don't let me brake you.)

(only tell me tell me the answer.
you may be a lover but you aint no dancer)

wasted truth.
why call it all, blue?
hot lines.
eventual decline.
with 
the right attitude 
you will succeed, blue.
resent that discontent
sidestep.
define 
the state of things 
so far.
crazy things, 
soft spoken..
override.
with your eyes open, 
you know soft spoken changes nothing.
a view so cruel.
nothing.

view so cruel
view so cruel
you so cruel
view so cruel
a view so cruel
a view so cruel

(..so cruel)

try and take over, 
over the fringe.
sloppy, eyesore, 
rotten, 
showstopper, 
skin popper.
a babbler and dabbler.
oh, change, 
change!
nothing.
nothing, 
so, 
no, 
nothing.
go, 
down.
go.
